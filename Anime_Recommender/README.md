Hello, 
I am Arnav Waghdhare, an closet weeb and machine learning enthusiast. I wanted to create an algorithm that would reccomend me anime, simple!

<h1><b>---------PROGRESS----------</b></h1>

Just added a readme!        -22/05/24

I was thinking of using the MyAnimeList top anime list, and scrape from there, but for a reccomender system, more than just score, popularity is needed! Hence I switched for using the API from AniList. They use GraphQL for there database, had learn how that works! 
Also web scraping on MAL is tiring to me! Would appreciate some help on that, as I can still use the suprise pylib and only work with the rating and/or popularity of shows! </br>
Update on the AniList dataset! I just need to convert the json file into a csv file, not sure on how but once I do that, converting from csv to Pandas dataframe wouldn't be much hard or viceversa!

<h2>Update on 23rd May</h2>
I will be going outstation so won't be able to continue this for the next 3 days. 

<h3> So Far Progress!! </h3>

The database seems to be completely ready for the model. Will have to research on what models should I be using, and what all columns I will be using for the model! </br>
I don't really have much idea on how to go any further, so the three day break is much needed. Please do send your suggestions on how should I go ahead!!!

<h3> Update 28th May </h3>
Yea, am fuqed, I haven't done anything related to EDA at the very leaast. let alone choose a model for the ML part. Let's see how far I can continue this project. Although I really want to finish this!
