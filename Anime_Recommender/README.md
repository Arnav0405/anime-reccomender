Hello, 
I am Arnav Waghdhare, an closet weeb and machine learning enthusiast. I wanted to create an algorithn that would reccomend me anime, simple!

Just added a readme!        -22/05/24
I was thinking of using the MyAnimeList top anime list, and scrape from there, but for a reccomender system, more than just score, popularity is needed! Hence I switched for using the API from AniList. They use GraphQL for there database, had learn how that works! 
Also web scraping on MAL is tiring to me! Would appreciate some help on that, as I can still use the suprise pylib and only work with the rating and/or popularity of shows! 
Update on the AniList dataset! I just need to convert the json file into a csv file, not sure on how but once I do that, converting from csv to Pandas dataframe wouldn't be much hard or viceversa!
