<h1>Recommender System using Cosine Similarity Metric</h1>

<h3>Hello, I am Arnav Waghdhare, an closet weeb and machine learning enthusiast. I wanted to create an algorithm that would reccomend me anime, simple!</br></h3>
In this repo, I have got my own set of anime data from the Anilist API. The data has 3205 anime titles in it.</br>
The folder has the csv file that contains the Anilist data. The python file has the details on how I used the API. The Jupyter notebook has got the recommending system.</br>
The last line in the notebook runs the getRecommendations function. </br>
We have to enter the exact name of the anime, either in English or in Romaji, please enter the exact one according to google or MyAnimeList.</br>
Results will be printed in Romaji, you can change it to english by changing the return line inside the function. But I won't recommend that as it sometimes messes up the list.</br>
